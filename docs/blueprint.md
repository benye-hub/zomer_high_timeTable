# **App Name**: TimeTable Navigator

## Core Features:

- Data Encoding: Encode the timetable data (extracted from the provided Excel file) directly within the application's HTML/JS code.
- Table Display: Display the timetable data in an HTML table format, organized by day, time, and class.
- Class Filtering: Allow users to filter the timetable to display only the classes for a specific subject/course.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue for the header and day labels, as seen in the design.
- Background color: Very light gray or white for the main content area and timetable cells, providing a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Use a slightly darker shade of blue or a complementary color to highlight the selected timetable cells or interactive elements.
- Use a clear and readable font, such as 'Arial' or 'Helvetica', for all text elements.
- Incorporate small, simple icons to represent class-related information, such as location or teacher. Use consistent and easily understandable icons.
- Use a grid-based layout to organize the timetable data. The days of the week should be displayed horizontally at the top, with time slots listed vertically on the left.
- Ensure the timetable cells are spacious enough to display all relevant information clearly.
- Subtle transitions for filtering and displaying timetable data to improve user experience.
